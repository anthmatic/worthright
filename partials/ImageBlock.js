              Your life policy is your property, just like your house. The value
              of your life insurance policy depends on many factors, but all
              things being equal, the value of a life policy today is
              significantly more valuable when converted to a life settlement,
              compared to letting the policy lapse, or selling it back to the
              insurance company.
